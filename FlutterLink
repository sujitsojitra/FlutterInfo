=>Working with the "textScaleFactor"
In this course, I mostly focus on the device sizes (height and width) when it comes to working with the MediaQuery class.
As mentioned, it offers way more than that of course. On particularly interesting property is the textScaleFactor property:
	.	final curScaleFactor = MediaQuery.of(context).textScaleFactor;
textScaleFactor tells you by how much text output in the app should be scaled. Users can change this in their mobile phone / device settings.
Depending on your app, you might want to consider using this piece of information when setting font sizes.
Consider this example:
	.	Text('Always the same size!', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20));
This text ALWAYS has a size of 20 device pixels, no matter what the user changed in his / her device settings.
	.	Text('This changes!', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20 * curScaleFactor));
This text on the other hand also has a size of 20 if the user didn't change anything in the settings (because textScaleFactor by default is 1). But if changes were made, the font size of this text respects the user settings.

=>SnackBar
If you're working with Flutter 2 or higher, you might see a deprecation warning regarding the hideCurrentSnackBar() and showSnackbar() methods.
You can get rid of them by using:
	.	ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).hideCurrentSnackBar()
	.	ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackbar(...)
instead of
	.	Scaffold.of(context).hideCurrentSnackBar()
	.	Scaffold.of(context).showSnackbar(...)

=>Adding "GoogleServices-Info.plist" correctly to iOS
I'll also show this later in a lecture but in case you try running the app on an iOS simulator or device and you're getting an error right now, make sure you add "GoogleServices-Info.plist" to the iOS project by:
1) Opening XCode and opening the iOS folder as a project there
2) Adding the "GoogleServices-Info.plist" file via "Add Files" (right click on "Runner" in the left bar and choose "Add Files to 'Runner'") => Select the "GoogleServices-Info.plist" file
